### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2018

+ Project title: Doubtful
+ This project is conducted by Richard Shin
+ Project summary: By inspecting the usage of stop words in modern language, we take another look at what defines horror stories from the 19th century and find that words for doubt and uncertainty are prevalent.
